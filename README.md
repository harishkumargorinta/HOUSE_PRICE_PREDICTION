# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

This Python project is designed to predict house prices using machine learning algorithms. It takes input features such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, the location, and other relevant parameters to predict the price of the house.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for predicting house prices based on input parameters. It utilizes machine learning techniques to train a model on historical data and then uses that model to predict house prices for new data points.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTION.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTION
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure that you have a dataset with relevant features (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location, etc.) and corresponding house prices.
   - The dataset should be in a format compatible with Pandas DataFrame.

2. Train the model:
   - Run the training script to train the machine learning model using your dataset.
   ```
   python train.py --dataset path_to_your_dataset.csv
   ```

3. Predict house prices:
   - Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict house prices for new data points.
   ```
   python predict.py
   ```

4. Visualize results (optional):
   - If you want to visualize the results or analyze the model's performance, you can run the visualization script.
   ```
   python visualize.py
   ```
